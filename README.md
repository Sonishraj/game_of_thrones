# Game of Thrones Character Prediction

<b>Overview</b> <br>

Game of Thrones is a hit fantasy tv show based on the equally famous book series "A Song of Fire and Ice" by George RR Martin. The show is well known for its vastly complicated political landscape, large number of characters, and its frequent character deaths. <br>

In this code, Logistic and Decision Tree classification models are used to predict the accurate results. <br>

For me Logistic was the best model with the test score of 78.97% and AUC is 59%.
